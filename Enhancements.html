These enhancements need to be implemented within the Web pages (index.html, topic.html, 
quiz.html). The extra features need to enhance your website in a relevant way.  
 
On a separate Web page called enhancements.html  list and describe each enhancement you have 
made and how you have significantly extended the basic HTML and CSS beyond what is covered in 
the Lectures/Tutorials. Hyperlink from this list to where the feature is implemented in your website. 
If it is a CSS feature, hyperlink to an example of the html that is selected by the CSS rule. For each 
enhancement feature briefly explain:  
 
 how it goes beyond the basic requirements of the assignment 
 what code is needed to implement the feature  
 if you have sourced your technique from a third party the source of this technique (e.g. URL) 
must be cited. 
 a hyperlink to where you have applied that extension in your website (this is needed so the 
marker can quickly assess your enhancements). 
 All enhancements must be able to run on the version of Firefox in the labs. Make sure you 
check this. 
 
A maximum of 2 enhancements will be assessed. Here are some examples of HTML/CSS 
enhancements:  
• Effective, appropriate  and innovative use of a  number of distinct  HTML elements not  covered 
in lectures/tutorials (e.g. Image maps) used in a way that improves the user experience of the 
website. 
• A number of  additional CSS properties or selectors (e.g. support for interactivity) not covered 
in  the  lectures/tutorials.  For  example  the  use  of  a  range  CSS3  pseudo-elements  and  classes, 
child or siblings combinators, attribute selectors, etc. (e.g. use the CSS3 :target selector to help 
us see where you have applied your enhancements.)  
• Implement  Responsive  Design  with  additional  CSS  that  presents  your  website  specifically  for 
mobile phone / tablet sized displays. 
• In  addition to your standard CSS, create another CSS files that re-implements and extends the 
style with a library/preprocessor such a Bootstrap, LESS or Sass. Demonstrate and document a 
number of cool features that can be implemented using the library.  
   
Discuss your proposed enhancements with your facilitator before you implement them. The number 
of marks you receive for an enhancement will be at the sole discretion of your marker. As a guide if 
the enhancement has only taken a couple of lines of code it is likely to be trivial. 
• Be relevant to / enhance the content of the website 
• Be well described (as explained above) 
• Be non-trivial.  
• Be significantly different from other features you have implemented.  -->
