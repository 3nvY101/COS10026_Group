	<h2> JSON History </h2>
	<h3>Who developed JSON</h3>
	<p>
		JSON was created by Douglas Crockford and Chip Morningstar between 2001 and 2002.
		“If XML were a superior document format, XHTML should easily have won over HTML, and it hasn't. HTML is still dominant, XHTML is failing.
		So, XML in the first place isn't a very good document format, and it's an even worse data interchange format.” - Douglas Crockford<span class="reference"><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></span><br>
		In contrast, JSON was designed as a data serialisation format in light of XML’s deficits
	</p>

	<h3>Who is responsible for managing it?</h3>
	<p>
		ECMA controls the JSON specification used to standardise the use of JSON through all computer systems.
		ECMA published the specification and also has the patent policy for it.
	</p>

	<h2>What is JSON?</h2>
	<h3>Purpose </h3>
	<p>
		JSON is a data interchange format, a text format used to exchange data between platforms. <span class="reference"><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></span>
		which may be used to communicate between largely different systems.
	</p>

	<h3>Creators Notes</h3>
	<p>Things to keep in mind when dealing with JSON syntax:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Double quotes (“) on either side of all strings is recommended over single quotes for interoperability</li>
		<li>JSON is object oriented, so all declarations should appear between curly brackets ( ‘{‘ and ‘}’ ), defining an object.</li>
		<li>Additional attributes of an object must be delineated with commas (‘,’)</li>
		<li>Arrays of values are delineated with commas and appear between square braces ( ‘[‘ and ‘]’ )</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>What IS JSON's Future </h3>

	<p>
		“JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.” <span class="reference"><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></span> <br>
		While these are words from the creators of JSON, they remain credible and are clearly demonstrated while not only using JSON, but also in its evident popularity due to frequent searches on Stack overflow..

		<h3>How does JSON compare</h3>
		<h4>XML (Extensible Markup Language) </h4>
		<aside>
			XML was originally made by the World Wide Web Consortium who also made HTML prior.
			However, HTML is now under the development of the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group.
		</aside>
		<p>
			XML is a markup language, used for data interchange. <br />
			It is the default choice as it’s fundamental format is standardised, allowing the recipient to parse the data.<br />
			Additionally tags are defined by the user, allowing for easier readability of data.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="topicterms2">
		<h4>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</h4>
		<p>
			JSON is an object notation, a text-based data interchange format.
			It is primarily used in Web browser-based code to represent simple data structures and objects.
			Which became popularised with programming using APIs code and web services.
			As it requires no additional code to parse, JSON is able to execute faster data interchanges.
